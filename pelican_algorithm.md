#### Google Classroom Form (topic submission)
- __Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA)__ is a nature-inspired, population-based metaheuristic introduced in 2022, modeled on the cooperative hunting behavior of pelicans. 
- It operates in two main phases: exploration, where pelicans randomly search the environment to __locate prey__, and exploitation, where they perform a __rapid diving movement toward the best-identified solution__. This helps balance global search and local refinement while maintaining fast convergence. POA is especially effective for continuous optimization problems where quick convergence is desirable. 
- However, like many swarm algorithms and also since it has __fast convergence__, it may suffer from __premature convergence in highly multimodal landscapes__, which we will try to optimize. 
- In real world applications, POA is used in engineering design to choose the best values for dimensions or materials so a system performs well. In ML, it helps in __feature selection__, meaning it picks the most important input features to improve __accuracy__ and __reduce complexity__. In power systems, POA is applied to decide how much electricity different power plants should generate to reduce cost while meeting demand, and so on.

#### learnings
- Endoscopic image analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosis Gastrointestinal Diseases (GD) by allowing visualization of the inner tissues of gastrointestinal tract. 
- However, quality of gastrointestinal images is often suboptimal and GD classification are complex and require multiple parameters to training, affecting their accuracy. 
- In this research, proposed Levy Flight Pelican Optimization Algorithm (LFPOA) and Ensemble Machine Learning (ML) method for classification using methods like Multi-Support Vector Machine (MSVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB). 
- The LFPOA reduces dimensionality, balances exploration and exploitation, leads to a global optimum, helping to select relevant features. 
- The EL combines five machine learning techniques to handle multiple classifiers and produce a single output, often leading to higher accuracy.
